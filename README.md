# Text-Flow
This is an assignment from my Android Application Development course SWEN3001 from GIST. It allows users to locate *Typography Rivers* in text.

In typography, rivers (or rivers of white) are gaps in typesetting which appear to run through a paragraph of text due to a coincidental alignment of spaces.
More info [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_(typography)).

## What the application looks like:

#### Upon opening the open

#### Example of user inputs
![User enters data](https://github.com/S-TJones/Text-Flow/blob/main/screenshots/Demo2.jpeg?raw=true)

#### Applications output

There may be more updates in the future.
